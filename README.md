# Sheets-Project

This is a showcase of my work for my client. He has a car rental business with about 20 vehicles. The main goals were to create a spreadsheet that can be used as a database, a dashboard, and a document to keep track of each car.

I was able to incorporate all of the client's requirements and ideas into a Google Sheet document. Here is the link to this project: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OT5Tij5I77_2mJ190WPrqXHMSBgVwwRm_jg0omUt6L8/edit?usp=sharing
